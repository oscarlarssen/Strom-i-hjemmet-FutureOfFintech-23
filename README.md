Website to help people pick the right  power provider for their needs // Norway 


## Task description

 I chose to make a website focused on educating the user, and providing some tools for picking the right provider. 

A key focus is that every homeowner has diffrent needs when it comes to customor service, stability and predictability. 
Therfore it is not nececearly the price alone that is important. As an example, i would recomend one of the bigger companies 
with good customer service, rather than the cheaper online based ones to my grandmother. The reason is because she values the 
opputinity to call somebody instead of chatting way more then the money she saves.

When starting the project i only knew the basics of python, so i decided to learn html, css and Java Script so i could make a 
product visuable for the user. 

The page is so far a basci html design with some css styling and a tiny bit of JS funcionality. 

Mid project i wanted to display the live updated price of a kwh for the vistitors, and used some time learning about api.

To host the page, i bought my first domene and signed up with hostinger. Threw this i learned about filezilla, and validator.


Here you can describe what tasks you decided to solve.

## Comments

Threw the project i have learned a little bit about many techonlogies. 
Another approach could be to focus mainly on design or functionality, but for me it was motivating to end up with something
visual and easy accsesed.



Comments regaring design choices, decisions, or anything at all.
