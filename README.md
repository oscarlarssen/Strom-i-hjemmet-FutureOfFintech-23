Website to help people pick the right  power provider for their needs // Norway 


## Task description

 I chose to make a website focused on educating the user, and providing some tools for picking the right provider. 

A key focus is that every homeowner has diffrent needs when it comes to customor service, stability and predictability. 
Therfore it is not nececearly the price alone that is important. As an example, i would recomend one of the bigger companies 
with good customer service, rather than the cheaper online based ones to my grandmother. The reason is because she values the 
opputinity to call somebody instead of chatting way more then the money she saves.

When starting the project i only knew the basics of python, so i decided to learn html, css and Java Script so i could make a 
product visuable for the user. 

The page is so far a basci html design with some css styling and a tiny bit of JS funcionality. 

Mid project i wanted to display the live updated price of a kwh for the vistitors, and used some time learning about api.

To host the page, i bought my first domene and signed up with hostinger. Though this i learned about filezilla, and validator.

To make the content of the pages i researched reviews of the diffrent providers, and called them to test their customer service.



## How to run
 
The page is hosted at https://oscarlarssen.com/electricity/

then the button " velg ny levrand√∏r" directs the user to :

https://velgriktig.oscarlarssen.com/

Else from that the buttons either have a function or an alert that says what i would do with more time

## Comments

Through the project i have learned a little bit about many techonlogies. 
Another approach could be to focus mainly on design or functionality, but for me it was motivating to end up with something
visual and easy accsesed for the user.

I added a short list of ideas for further developemnt beneith the example pictures on the home page. 

The hompage is made to work good also on mobile phones, that can sadly not be said for the "velgriktig". 

this i would also improve with more time.

All in all i enjoyed working with the task, and appreciate the oppertunity to attend.
